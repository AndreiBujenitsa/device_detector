# DeviceDetector

![Podigee DeviceDetector Travisci Badge](https://travis-ci.org/podigee/device_detector.svg)

User agent parser and device detector backed by the largest, most precise and up-to-date agent and device database.

DeviceDetector will parse any user agent and detect the browser, operating system, device used (desktop, tablet, mobile, tv, cars, console, etc.), brand and model.

The DeviceDetector is optimized for speed of detection, by providing optimized code and in-memory caching.

This project originated as a Ruby port of the Universal Device Detection library.
You can find the original code here: https://github.com/piwik/device-detector.

## Disclaimer

This port does not aspire to be a one-to-one copy from the original code, but rather an adaptation for the Ruby language.

Still, our goal is to use the original, unchanged regex yaml files, in order to mutually benefit from updates and pull request to both the original and the ported versions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'device_detector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install device_detector

## Usage

```ruby
user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/30.0.1599.17 Safari/537.36'
client = DeviceDetector.new(user_agent)

client.name # => 'Chrome'
client.full_version # => '30.0.1599.69'

client.os_name # => 'Windows'
client.os_full_version # => '8'

# For many devices, you can also query the device name (usually the model name)
# Look into regexes/devices/mobiles.yml to see what devices can be detected
client.device_name # => 'iPhone 5'
client.device_type # => 'smartphone' # device types can be one of `smartphone`, `tablet`, `console`, `portable media player`, `tv`, `car browser` or `camera`
```

`DeviceDetector` will return `nil` on all attributes, if the `user_agent` is unknown.
You can make a check to ensure the client has been detected:

```ruby
client.known? # => will return false if user_agent is unknown
```

### Memory cache

`DeviceDetector` will cache up 5,000 user agent strings to boost parsing performance.
You can tune the amount of keys that will get saved in the cache:

```ruby
# You have to call this code **before** you initialize the Detector
DeviceDetector.configure do |config|
  config.max_cache_keys = 20_000 # increment this if you have enough RAM, proceed with care
end
```
